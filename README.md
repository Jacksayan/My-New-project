# Easy Translate
Creating an application for Translation chatting
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
This application has created in the moto to break the language barrier with people those who frequently travel and those who living in a differnt country to work or study,
creating bonds intenationally
Creating innovation in communication in world wide 
## Background
Basically this project about creating an application for Android and IOS to translate the texts and voices for some other language. This is really helpful for someone who works in differnt countries, students who study in some intenational countries and for tourists.That can be a traslation application and also a key board. Commonly while some employees those who works in abroad find difficulties to talk with their co-workers in their day to day life, so this application will helpful for them. and if an international student would have to interact with there collegue according with some group work or some assignment or sometimes they would have some difficulties with some words so this application will helpful like a modern dictionaly. maybe In some callcenter if they suppose to interact with some international client, they can use this application as a helpfulresources. I got this Idea from some of my personal experiance. As I living as an International student where english is not a national language and English is also not that much familier for me also, So Sometimes I have struggled to interact with the people those who has less knowledge in English so I strongly belive that is application will be helpful also for the students like me. As I Curious about the world languages this project will be more interesting for me.  
This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* We going to break the Language Barrier
* make the communication much easier
## How is it used?
This Application basically created to make easy communication between two people with differnet language. probably people who requlerly visit new countries will use this application.

def main():
   Languages = ['English', 'French', 'Tamil', 'Latvian', 'Spanish']
   pop = [400million,450million,82million,1.2Million,486million]   
   
   totlang = sum(lang)
   totpop = sum(pop)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(Languages)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (Languages[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
We're collecting data from language specelists around the world, basiclly from dictionaries and kind of articles. 


| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges
Sometimes there will be a challege with word changes according to differnt countries with same languages. so some people won't able to understand there own language itselves

## What next?
As much as we put the correct data tothe system, we can achive a best translation system to the world.
